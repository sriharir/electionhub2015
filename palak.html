						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>There does not exist a centralized system mechanism for students to find out about ongoing events in the Technology General Championship, the current standings and the basic information required to 
participate in the events of the Technology General Championship. Students interested to participate in 
various events often do not get the proper guidance and materials required.This is also one of the 
reasons for the lower turnout of the students for Technology General Championship.It will contain the 
basic information about the event, current standings of different Halls of Residences and pre­requisite 
required to participate in the event. 
</p>
