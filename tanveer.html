                        <h3>1. International association for Tech GC</h3>
					<p><b>Overview : </b> I propose to introduce the association of General Championship Technology, Technology Students 

Gymkhana with various international and national societies working in the field of technology. The 

association with these societies will provide the certifications for various events of General Championship 

Technology, hence making the events more competitive and will provide students recognition from the 

leaders of the industry.</p>
<p><b>Requirement : </b>General Championship Technology consists of 10 events centring towards betterment of students as well

as helping them to learn various aspects of technology. Students from various halls of residences work all 

around the year to give their best result. Getting certified by renowned societies can uplift the level of 

competition as well as giving a chance to students of IIT Kharagpur to interact with intellectuals from 

various societies.</p>
 


      <h3>2. Kshitij Live Streaming</h3>
					<p><b>Overview : </b> I propose to introduce the live streaming of various guest lectures and workshops which will be held 

during Kshitij 2016 in partnered universities and colleges all over the country. This will help the students 

who are not able to come to Kharagpur during Kshitij 2016 to experience the thoughts shared by eminent 

personalities as well as to learn from workshops within their college. It will also led to increase in 

participation from respective colleges apart from online events.</p>
<p><b>Requirement : </b>The live streaming of the guest lectures and workshops of Kshitij 2016 would be instrumental in

significantly increasing their reach. This would be especially beneficial for those participants who are not 

able to Kharagpur due to travel issues, both inside India and abroad. The videos would also help 

enormously in Kshitij online publicity, since the guest lectures and workshops are one of the most sought 

after facets of the fest.</p>

   <h3>3. Seminar for PG students and RS</h3>
					<p><b>Overview : </b> I propose to introduce an Introduction Seminar for Post Graduate and Research Scholars regarding 

Technology General Championship and Kshitij giving them the various platforms available in IIT 

Kharagpur on the Technology front. A booklet depicting information regarding all the events which are 

conducted in Technology General Championship as well

student at the start of academic year.</p>
<p><b>Requirement : </b>From past years it had been seen that there is less number of participation from Post graduate and 

Research scholars in various events which are conducted under Technology General Championship and 

Kshitij. It might be due to the lack of information dissipation regarding various aspects available inside 

campus on the technology front. Post graduate and Research Scholars having an edge on the knowledge 

part can do better if the information is provided to them on a regular basis as well as at the start of 

academic year.</p>
