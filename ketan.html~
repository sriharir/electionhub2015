                        <h3>1. Maintenance Monitoring Committee</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>Proposal to introduce a Maintenance Monitoring committee which aims to assist in rigorous inspection and maintenance of the campus and halls in general. Also to start an Online Complain Portal (OCP), where students can put up there complaints regarding any maintenance issues faced by them.</p>
<p><b>Aim : </b>I propose to introduce a Maintenance Monitoring Committee which aims to assist in the rigorous inspection and maintenance of all the halls of residence and will also look after the general hygiene and cleanliness of the campus, for instance - Regular cleaning of the three water bodies in the campus, Waste management in the campus and so on. This committee aims to highlight the problems regarding various maintenance issues namely infrastructural and cleanliness issues and also take into consideration the problems faced by individual students. I also propose to start an Online Complain Portal (OCP), where students can put up their complaints regarding any prevalent maintenance issues.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>There is no feedback system to counter check whether the complaints of students regarding general maintenance are addressed.</li>
