                        <h3>1. Students' International Relations Cell</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>Formation of a student body under the Dean AA&IR that will assist the Office of Alumni Affairs & International Relations in expanding and improving the international presence of IIT Kharagpur.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>The Office of Alumni Affairs & International Relations is currently developing the alumni relations and is yet to focus on International Relations programs of IIT Kharagpur.</li>
									<li>In line with the current proposal of Dean UGS, there is an urgent need to expand to a fully functional international relations cell which will facilitate the process of exchange semesters for the students of IIT Kharagpur.</li>
									<li>Increasing and regulating the number of internship opportunities in foreign universities. The scope of the institute’s current approach is restricted to ONLY “MoU-signed universities”. The SIRC will aim at increasing this number and thus creating a larger number of opportunities catering to all departments/schools/centers.</li>

									<li>Catering to the growing interest of students towards participation in international conferences and completions like HULT Prize, South American Business Forum, HPAIR, World Business Dialogue etc.</li>
									<li>Developing a framework where students can approach to Foreign Universities and facilitate academic collaboration through Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs).</li>
</ul>

						</p>


 


 <h3>2. English Learning Programme, IIT Kharagpur</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>To provide students with the opportunity to enhance their English Levels by enrolling in optional English Learning Programme by British Council thus increasing the average level of English proficiency among students at IIT Kharagpur.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>Over the years it has been observed that quality of communicative English among students is not adequate. The feedbacks given by different companies seeking recruits from IIT Kharagpur and Universities enrolled in Student Exchange Programme with IIT Kharagpur have repeatedly conveyed that our students don’t have satisfactory communication skills. Therefore, there is a need to introduce a course aimed at “limited-English proficient” students in particular, while simultaneously catering to all students on different levels. There is a need of an in-depth assessment of one’s English skills. </li>

</ul>

						</p>

<h3>3. Placement Advisory Committee</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>Formation of a new body (Proposed name: Placement Advisory Committee) under the Career Development Center which will help enhance the placement opportunities at IIT KGP. The Committee will consist of globally recognized alumni who will advice the Chairman, CDC in attracting top-tier recruiters to IIT KGP.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>Formation of a new body (Proposed name: Placement Advisory Committee) under the Career Development Center which will help enhance the placement opportunities at IIT KGP. The Committee will consist of globally recognized alumni who will advice the Chairman, CDC in attracting top-tier recruiters to IIT KGP.</li>
									<li>Currently, the Institute lacks a dedicated framework to approach and involve these highly positioned alumni to facilitate Placements at IIT Kharagpur.</li>
									<li>There is currently a lack of participation from a significant number of top tier recruiters in the placement drive at IIT KGP specifically in the fields of consulting, finance, core engineering as well as global start-ups (eg.  Dropbox, SpaceX, Palantir, Uber, etc.)</li>

									<li>The formation of a committee aims at tapping on potential top-tier recruiters through the personal and professional network of the alumni forming a part of the committee</li>
									<li>We can actively involve Distinguished Alumnus Awardees and industry leaders in attracting recruiters to IIT KGP</li>
</ul>

						</p>

<h3>4. अनुराग</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>The TSG will work in association with Counselling Centre and Student Welfare Group to organise yearlong events in the following fields. Awareness drives, aimed at specific topics will be organised throughout the year.
External Speakers, NGO-groups, professional agencies, working in these specific areas will be invited on campus to deliver workshops and lectures (on weekends). The lectures will be recorded and uploaded to reach a wider audience.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>LGBT AWARENESS : This initiative is aimed at enveloping a culture of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) inclusion. The drive is aimed at anyone interested in increasing their LGBT awareness. The goal of the course is to encourage the use of LGBT inclusive communication by building greater awareness of diversity during day-to-day interactions.</li>
									<li>SUICIDE PREVENTION : This initiative is aimed at understanding and preventing suicide through advocacy, open discussions, lectures and awareness drives. This programme is designed at creating awareness and supporting individuals dealing with emotional stresses.</li>
									<li>SEX & RELATIONSHIP EDUCATION GUIDANCE : This initiative aims to prepare students for the responsibilities and experiences of adult life. It is also about the teaching of sex, sexuality, and sexual health. It is not about the promotion of sexual orientation or sexual activity – which would be inappropriate teaching.</li>
</ul>

						</p>

<h3>5. Suraksha | Women Safety App</h3>
						<p><b>Overview and Scope : </b>  To overcome the instances of eve-teasing and harassment of female students and enhance their safety anytime and anywhere at IIT KGP. This is done with the help of an App which sends a text message (distress message) including the web link that displays one’s location to one or more people and also sounds an alarm.</p>
						<p><b>Why and how is it necessary?</b>
									<ul>
									<li>Over the years there have been numerous instances of eve teasing within the campus. There have been numerous reported instances of sexual aggression that ranges in severity from sexually suggestive remarks, brushing in public places to catcalls. Inspite of having full connectivity through our Wifi-enabled campus, we currently lack a system to inform the security authorities in case a woman is in need of assistance/rescue. There have been numerous instances reported during SpringFest/Kshitij when the campus witnesses outstation participation from various colleges. There is a need for a system that is able to provide immediate aid to women in distress, by informing the security section at IIT KGP. This ensures a rapid response and quick rescue from any situation that may lead to a mishap. This app will help in notifying the authorities and will be able to pin point your exact location in seconds.</li>
</ul>
